# Obsolete Blocks {#/palette/obsolete/}

::: info

This is an interesting idea, but its inclusion is up for debate. Feel free to offer insight!

:::

This section reimagines blocks that *were* supported in earlier versions of Scratch, but have since been removed from Scratch 3.0 or left in an inoperative state. Its goal is to closely recreate what the functionality of these blocks *would* have been if they had been kept in Scratch and were supported by Scratch 3.0.

This way, one could theoretically create an implementation of Scratch 3.0 that accurately supports *every* block from *every* official Scratch version, though obviously with subtle differences due to changes in behavior between Scratch versions.

Unlike the rest of this specification, the content of this section is more up to the imagination, as it dreams of how obsolete blocks *would* behave in modern Scratch, and is not actually observing the behavior of these blocks directly (though it should stay as close as possible to the block's original behavior).
