# Contributing

**Please contribute!** I need help with this. There are some guidelines evolving in my mind for how to format and structure the spec, but I haven't written them down yet. Don't worry, I'll reformat whatever you contribute to conform to these unwritten rules for you. What matters right now is writing this spec! Find TODO sections and **be bold**. Make pull requests, raise issues, write sections!! IDC what way you do it, just help or something. :D
