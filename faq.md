# FAQ

*Questions that would be frequently asked if someone were to ask them.*

## Where to start?

* If you want a **general understanding** of Scratch's inner workings for whatever reason, find whatever interests you in the [table of contents](#contents) and just gloss over whatever you don't need to know.
* If you want **formal definitions** of Scratch terms, see [concepts](#concepts).
* If you want to accurately **recreate blocks**, see the [palette](#palette).

TODO: Threading and execution behavior will be documented soon!

* If you want to learn about project files, see [file format](#file-format).
* If you want to recreate old blocks, see [obsolete blocks](#obsolete-blocks).
* If you want more blocks, see [nonstandard blocks](#nonstandard-blocks).

## What's the point?

This specification exists to document the behavior of Scratch 3.0 as a programming language. It can open the door to:

* **Accurately porting Scratch to run natively on other platforms**
  * It could help efforts to make Scratch available on platforms that aren't web-based (if any).
  * @OceanIsEndless, the initial creator of this specification, has a lot of wild ideas on their mind regarding Scratch. Their ideas are likely not at all worth their time, but writing this spec will allow them to try doing interesting things such as creating a Scratch to [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) packager, or porting Scratch to the [Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii). A bit ambitious, yes, and absolutely crazyâ€”but a specification like this could aid projects like these and more. It can help ensure compatibility and easy coding.
  * It could help this super cool rapidly-developing [3DS port](https://github.com/NateXS/Scratch-3DS), though the spec may not be done before contributors  over there figure out how Scratch works for themselves anyway. :)
* **Recreating parts of Scratch (blocks, scripts) for demonstration**
  * For educational reasons, one might want to recreate the behavior of certain parts of Scratch without the full force of the Scratch editor on hand. This spec will eventually provide information ranging from exact block behaviors to full-on runtime execution, making understanding the way each part of Scratch works simple.
* **Improving Scratch in the future while keeping it 100% compatible**
  * It isn't known if this spec will reach a state that the developers of Scratch could use as reference, but if so, it could help ensure that Scratch projects remain functionally the same after code rewrites.
* **Directly citing the workings of Scratch without linking wikis or code**
  * Although the [Scratch Wiki](https://scratch-wiki.info/) and code of Scratch work well for showing Scratch concepts and runtime behavior, one of them tends to abstract away particular functionalities while the other offers thousands of lines of pure [JavaScript](#javascript). This specification is meant to serve as one clear and concise document explaining the behaviors, blocks, and quirks of Scratch 3.0 in all its blocky glory.
* **Reimplementing Scratch 3.0 in case of catastrophe**
  * This kind of blends together all of the previous points. If the Scratch editor were to magically disappear or break entirely (it won't, but in theory), then the Scratch Wiki could guide you in making a fairly accurate reimplementation of Scratch, but would fall short in exactly reproducing the runtime behavior, procedures, and quirks of Scratch, from scratch (literally). Although the wiki strives to be all-encompassing (and it is indeed very far-reaching), a document solely dedicated to the functionality of Scratch will help preserve its literal, programmatic behavior in one organized doc.
* **"Real" programming languages have them.**
  * [Scratch is cool](https://blob.codes/scratch-is-cool/). It is [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness). Lots of languages far less significant than Scratch have [programming language specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_specification). And yet Scratch lacks one. The Scratch Wiki helps document the **ideas** of Scratch, but a singular document dedicated to specifying *exactly* all that Scratch does could help it secure official programming language status.
* **Who knows what?**
  * If this spec is made reliable enough, it could be cited (or at least, the underlying sources that it will eventually reference for verifability) in the underdeveloped [Wikipedia page about Scratch ***as a programming language***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)).
  
It could be argued that this specification is reinventing the wheel in some ways. However, if it is ever completed, it could serve as a great resource for Scratch 3.0.
