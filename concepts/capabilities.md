# Capabilities

At its core, Scratch should be able to:

* Run scripts dynamically; multithreading, looping, timing, etc.
* Show images on a screen; position, size, turn + draw graphics.
* Play sounds on speakers; several audio files can play at once.

In an ideal situation, it should also be able to:

* Apply effects to images and sounds
* Detect loudness via microphone
* Interact with linked devices
* Draw graphics dynamically
* Make requests to the web
* Know the current time
* Receive user input

A fully functional implementation of Scratch should be capable of all these things, and if not handle it gracefully, this document detailing how to deal with everything.
