# Palette

This section aims to document the programmatic behavior of every block in Scratch 3.0.

::: info

This spec is in early stages, and its scope is still being considered. Although this section is primarily meant to document blocks that exist in the official version of Scratch 3.0, the extent to which it should try to document obsolete and nonstandard blocks has not yet been determined. Feel free to offer insight!

:::

The following blocks are being documented here:

* [Standard Blocks](./standard/): All blocks that are supported or exist in Scratch 3.0.
* [Nonstandard Blocks](./nonstandard/): All blocks that are supported or exist in [modifications](/ideas/#mod) of Scratch 3.0.
* [Obsolete Blocks](./obsolete/): All blocks that existed in previous versions of Scratch, and how they would *probably* behave if they were still functional in Scratch 3.0.
