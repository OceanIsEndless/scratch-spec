At [runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)#Runtime), Scratch [projects](/ideas/concepts/#project) are executed, or run. The Scratch [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) is responsible for providing a project with the memory and services needed for it to run. It contains the project in a sandboxed Scratch environment, which makes it possible for projects to run across several platforms. This section serves to explain how projects are interpreted and executed by the Scratch VM, including [script](/ideas/concepts/#script) and [target](/ideas/concepts/#target) handling.
